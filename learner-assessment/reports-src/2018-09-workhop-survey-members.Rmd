## Overview

Since `r format(min(c(dc_dates, swc_dates)), format="%B %d, %Y")`, Software and Data Carpentry have collected information on learner demographics, perception of tools, and confidence in working with data. As a benefit of partnering with the Carpentries, the Assessment Team will release bi-annual snapshots of the results of pre- and post-workshop surveys and instructor training, customized for each member organization. 

This report covers the workshops from `r format(min(swc_dates), format="%B %d, %Y")` to `r format(max(swc_dates), format="%B %d, %Y")` for Software Carpentry, and from  `r format(min(dc_dates), format="%B %d, %Y")` to `r format(max(dc_dates), format="%B %d, %Y")` for Data Carpentry.

As an overview, `r n_learners_pre_dc` and `r n_learners_post_dc` learners have responded to Data Carpentry pre- and post-workshop surveys respectively at your institution, while `r n_learners_pre_swc` and `r n_learners_post_swc` have responded to Software Carpentry workshop surveys. 

This report includes the following:

- Member Site History
- Number of Workshops (SWC, DC)
- List and Dates of Workshops and Number of Participants
- Participant Data from Learner Reports
- Net Promoter Score
- Applicability of the Skills Learned
- Instructor Training Information (where available)
- Summary

## Member Site History
[SITE NAME] has been a member site with The Carpentries since XX at the XX membership level. Check out our [website](https://carpentries.org/membership/) for information on membership tiers.

## Number of Workshops
Since XX, there have been XX Data Carpentry and XX Software Carpentry workshops at your institution.

## List and Dates of Workshops and Number of Participants
Below we have outlined a list of the dates of your workshops since XX, and number of participants. We rely on the instructors to tell us how many participants attended workshops. If your records do not match this list, please [contact Elizabeth Williams](mailto:ewilliams@carpentries.org).

## Participant Data from Learner Reports

Understanding why learners attend Carpentries workshops may help you in your strategy to organize and host workshops. Thus, we've provided a synopsis of participant data from learner reports as follows:

- Learner Demographics
- Why learners participate in workshops at your institution
- Paired Data (for workshops with more than 30 respondents)
- Perception of Instructors 
- Quantitative Responses

### Learner Demographics
#### Discipline

The distribution of your learners by discipline is provided below for both Data and Software Carpentry workshops held at your institution.
```{r dc-discipline, eval=has_dc_predata}
## Domain 
## Tally Data Carpentry's pre-workshop respondents by Discipline
## Responses are in columns 'Discipline' through 'Column13'
dc_discipline_data <- dcpredata %>%
    extract_multi_columns("discipline")

dc_discipline <- dc_discipline_data %>%
    summarize_multi_columns()

get_dc_discipline_percent <- function(discipline_var, .data = dc_discipline) {
    extract_percentage(.data, .var = column_name, .value = discipline_var) 
}

dc_discipline %>%
    render_table(
        question, 
        col.names = c("Data Carpentry's Respondents by Discipline", "n", "%")
    )
```

```{r swc-discipline, eval=has_swc_predata}
# Tally Software Carpentry's pre-workshop respondents by Discipline
# Responses are in columns 'Domain' through 'Column61'
swc_discipline_data <- swcpredata %>%

    render_table(
        question, 
        col.names = c("Software Carpentry's Respondents by Discipline", "n", "%"))
```

#### Career Stage

The figures below provide a breakdown of your learners by career stage for both Data and Software Carpentry workshops.

XXX% of Data Carpentry learners attended workshops at your institution to learn skills they can apply to their current work.

Software Carpentry‚Äôs curriculum teaches basic lab skills for scientific computing. These workshops include automation with the Unix shell, version control with Git, and programming with R or Python. These tools help learners to increase the efficiency and reproducibility of their computational work.

```{r swc-why-attending, eval=has_swc_predata}
# Why are you attending this workshop?
swc_why_attending_data <- swcpredata %>%
    extract_multi_columns("why_attending")
    
swc_why_attending <- swc_why_attending_data %>%
    summarize_multi_columns()

### inline statistics

    )
```	


```{r first-timers-swc, eval=has_swc_predata}
# 1st time attending 
# Software Carpentry: Will this be your first time attending a SWC workshop (as a learner)?

swc_first_timers <- swcpredata %>%

    render_table(
        first_time, 
        col.names = c ("Software Carpentry 1st Time Learners", "n", "%")
    )
```

Compared to Data Carpentry's learners, Software Carpentry's tend to have more experience with the tools covered in the workshops, and learners come to learn new and/or additional topics (X%). 

### Paired Data (for workshops with more than 30 respondents)
## Effect of Workshops on Learners Self-Reported Perspectives: Skills & Confidence

Your learners were asked to rate their level of agreement with several statements related to Data Carpentry's workshop goals and learning objectives. The figure below provides a visual representation of their responses, comparing them before the workshop and after the workshop. Axis labels and the corresponding question are organized around three themes as follows:

* Efficiency:
    + __Write Program__: I can write a small program/script/macro to solve a
      problem in my own work.
    + __Programming Efficient__: Using a programming language (like R or
      Python) can make me more efficient at working with data.
* Reproducibility:
	  + __Raw Data__: Having access to the original, raw data is important to be
	  able to repeat an analysis.
	  + __Analyses Easier__: Using a programming language (like R or Python) can
      make my analyses easier to reproduce.
* Self-Efficacy
	  + __Search Online__: I know how to search for answers to my technical
      questions online.
	  + __Overcome Problem__: While working on a programming project, if I get
      stuck, I can find ways of overcoming the problem.
	  + __Programming Confident__: I am confident in my ability to make use of
      programming software to work with data.

The scoring for the above factors ranges from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5).

The comparison above is paired, meaning, we are comparing those who provided us with a unique identifier and who completed both the pre- and post-workshop survey. This figure includes X responses.

In the figures below, we show another representation of the pre- and post-comparison of respondents skills and perspectives. The figures below include the data for all learners, not only those who provided a unique identifier *and* took both the pre- and post-workshop surveys.

The neutral centered graphs below provide an even clearer picture of the shift in respondents' self-reported confidence and skills.

### Perception of Instructors 
Your Data Carpentry workshop respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with several statements regarding their instructors' knowledge, instructional method, and enthusiasm. Their responses are in the figure below, and axis labels correspond to the statements as follows:

+ __Instructors Knowledge__: The instructors were knowledgeable about the material being taught.
+ __Instructors Interacting__: I felt comfortable interacting with the instructors. 
+ __Instructors Enthusiastic__: The instructors were enthusiastic about the workshop.
+ __Instructors Clear Answers__: I was able to get clear answers to my questions from the instructors.

X% of respondents said they felt comfortable interacting with the instructors. X% and X% of respondents felt your instructors were knowledgeable about the material being taught, and were enthusiastic about the workshop, respectively. Lastly, X% of respondents felt they were able to get clear answers to their questions from their instructors.

Software Carpentry respondents were asked to rate how they felt instructors and helpers worked as a team, based on the following criteria:

+ __Considerate__: Instructors/Helpers were considerate.
+ __Enthusiastic__: Instructors/Helpers were enthusiastic. 
+ __Clear Answers__: Instructors/Helpers gave clear answers to your questions. 
+ __Communicators__: Instructors/Helpers were good communicators.    

The two neutral centered plots below provide an analysis of respondent's answers for both instructors and helpers.

### Quantitative Responses



## Net Promoter Score
We use the [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) to measure learners' likelihood of recommending workshops to a friend or colleague. The scoring for this question is on a 0 to 100 scale. Respondents scoring from 0 to 64 are labeled *Detractors*, and are believed to be less likely to recommend a workshop. Those who respond with a score of 85 to 100 are called *Promoters*, and are considered likely to recommend a workshop. Respondents between 65 and 84 are labeled *Passives*, and their behavior falls between Promoters and Detractors.

```{r nps-code}
compute_nps <- . %>%
    pull(likely_to_recommend) %>%
    as.numeric() %>% 
    npc(breaks = list(0:64, 65:84, 85:100)) %>%
    data_frame(category = .) %>%
    mutate(category = as.character(category),
           category = replace_na(category, "Didn't answer")) %>% 
    count(category) %>%
    mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
    arrange(category = factor(category,
                              levels = c("Detractor",  "Passive",
                                         "Promoter",
                                         "Didn't answer")))
compute_nps_percent <- . %>%
    filter(category != "Didn't answer") %>%
    mutate(p = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
    filter(category == "Promoter") %>% 
    pull(p) 
```

```{r dc-nps, eval=has_dc_postdata}
## NPS 
## Data Carpentry
dc_nps  <- dcpostdata %>%
    compute_nps

dc_nps %>%
    render_table(
        category, 
        col.names = c("Data Carpentry Net Promoter Score", "n", "%"),
        arrange = FALSE
    )

dc_nps_promoters <- dc_nps %>%
    compute_nps_percent
```

X% of your Data Carpentry respondents who answered this question are promoters (i.e. would recommend a workshop). 

```{r swc-nps, eval=has_swc_postdata}
# NPS
# Software Carpentry
swc_nps <- swcpostdata %>%
    mutate(likely_to_recommend = as.numeric(likely_to_recommend) * 10) %>%
    compute_nps

swc_nps_percent <- swc_nps %>%
    compute_nps_percent
```

For Software Carpentry respondents who answered this questions, X% are promoters.

We hope you share in our committment to making participation in workshops a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of who learners are, where they are from, or what their experience is with the tools we teach. We teach instructors to establish norms for interaction by having, discussing, and enforcing a Code of Conduct so that your workshops provide open and inclusive learning environments. X% of Data Carpentry respondents from your workshops either agree or strongly agree that they felt comfortable learning in their workshop environment, and X% of Software Carpentry's respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the workshop atmosphere was welcoming.

## Applicability of the Skills Learned

```{r dc-skill-applicability, eval=has_dc_postdata}
## Data Carpentry: I can immediately apply what I learned at this workshop
applicability_levels <- c("Strongly disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree",
                          "Strongly agree", "Didn't answer")

dc_applicability <- dcpostdata %>%
    summarize_single_column(immediately_apply, applicability_levels)

dc_applicability_percent <- dc_applicability %>%
    filter(immediately_apply %in% c("Agree", "Strongly agree")) %>%
    summarize(p = sum(percent)) %>%
    pull(p)
```

One of the goals for Data Carpentry's lessons is that learners are able to
immediately apply what they learned at the workshop. The figure below shows that
X% either agree or strongly agree that they were able to apply what they learned immediately after attending a workshop at your institution.

```{r dc-skill-applicability-plot, eval=has_dc_postdata}
ggassessment_lolli(dc_applicability,
                   aes(y = factor(immediately_apply,
                                  levels = rev(applicability_levels)),
                       x = percent), color = "dc") +
    labs(
        title = "Data Carpentry respondents can immediately apply \nwhat they learned at the workshop" 
    )
```

## Instructor Training Information 

## Summary
In summary, we hope that you will use the figures above as a resource to make the case to continue organizing Software and Data Carpentry workshops at your institution.

This report focused on Data and Software Carpentry learners' skills, perspectives, and experiences in your workshops. Our two-day coding workshops increase researchers‚Äô daily programming usage, and confidence in working with open source tools.
