## Overview

To date, `r n_learners` learners have completed the Carpentries Long-Term Impact Survey between `r format(min(dates), format="%B %d, %Y")` and `r format(max(dates), format="%B %d, %Y")`. The average amount of time spent completing this survey is six minutes, and it carries an 80% completion rate. The survey was created in March 2017, and data is collected bi-annually. The results of this analysis are cumulative. We invite the community to run their own analyses. All of the data and source code are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment/tree/master/learner-assessment).

A special thanks to [Ben Markwick](https://twitter.com/benmarwick), [FranÃ§ois Michonneau](https://twitter.com/fmic_) and others who helped write the code used in this report.

### Demographics

+ Country
+ Field and Career Stage
+ Gender and Racial/Ethnic Identity

#### Breakdown of Respondents by Country

#### Breakdown of Respondents by Gender and Racial/Ethnic Identity
Gender Identity and Racial/Ethnic Identity was added to the survey during the second round of data collection, so these numbers do not reflect the cumulative amount of respondents.

```{r}
# What is your gender?
# Gender was added to the survey during the second round of data collection. 
gender = c("Female", "Male", "I prefer not to say")
gender = factor(gender)

impactdata$Gender = factor(impactdata$Gender, levels = gender)

impactdata_gender_tally <-
 impactdata %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  tally() %>%
  filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>%
  mutate(perc = round(n/sum(n) * 100, 0))

kable(impactdata_gender_tally, format = 'markdown', row.names = NA, col.names = c("Gender Identity", "n", "%"))

```

```{r}
# How would you describe yourself?
# Responses are in columns 'Race' through 'Column50'
n_responses_race <-
  n_responses_to_the_question(impactdata,
                              from_colname = Race,
                              to_colname = Column50)

# Workshop Impact
The statements below reflect ways in which completing a Carpentries may impact learners. We asked respondents to rate level of agreement with these statements:

+ __Reproducible__: I have made my analyses more reproducible as a result of completing the workshop.
+ __Recognition__: I have received professional recognition for my work as a result of using the tools I learned at the workshop.
+ __Productivity__: My research productivity has improved as a result of completing the workshop.
+ __Motivation__: I have been motivated to seek more knowledge about the tools I learned at the workshop.
+ __Confidence__: I have gained confidence in working with data as a result of completing the workshop.
+ __Coding__: I have improved my coding practices as a result of completing the workshop.
+ __Career__: I have used skills I learned at the workshop to advance my career.

The heatmap below provides a breakdown of responses.
```{r}
# Jonah's fix to include the correct levels. Variable was renamed to 'levels'
# because 'order' is the name of a function in R.

cols_with_Agree <- map_lgl(impactdata, ~`%in%`("Agree", .x))
data_agree <-  impactdata[ , cols_with_Agree]

levels = c("Strongly disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly agree")

We are also interested in understanding what impact our workshops have on respondents long-term. This includes the following:

+ Change in Confidence
+ Usage of Tools for Research and/or Work
+ Contributions to Academic Writing
+ Involvement in the Carpentries
+ Continuous Learning

#### Change in Confidence
We asked respondents to rate their change in confidence in the tools that were covered during their Carpentries workshops compared to before the workshop. The figure below provides a synopsis.

```{r}
# Code for change in confidence
confidence <-
  c("I am less confident now.",
    "I am equally confident now.",
    "I am more confident now.")
confidence = factor(confidence)

impactdata$ChangeInConfidence = factor(impactdata$ChangeInConfidence, levels = confidence)

impactdata_change_in_confidence_tally <-
  impactdata %>%
  group_by(ChangeInConfidence) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(`%` = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(ChangeInConfidence))
```

```{r longterm_change_in_confidence}
ggplot(impactdata_change_in_confidence_tally,
       aes(ChangeInConfidence, y = 100 * (n/sum(n)),
           n)) +
   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkcyan") +
   geom_text(aes(label=n), size= 4, vjust=-0.25) +
   scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) lapply(strwrap(x, width = 10, simplify = FALSE), paste, collapse="\n")) +
   theme_classic() +
   xlab("Change in Confidence") +
   ylab("% Respondents") +
   ggtitle("Respondents Change in Confidence 6 or More \nMonths After a Workshop") +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
   theme_bw(base_size = 14)
```

```{r}
# status <- unique(impactdata$Status)
# status <- factor(status[!is.na(status)])
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# # What is your position?
# status <- factor(status, levels(status)[c(7, 3, 6, 2, 1, 5, 4)])
# # Display ordering.
# print(levels(status))
# 
# impactdata$Position <-
#   factor(impactdata$Status, levels = levels(status))
# 
# change_in_confidence_by_status <- impactdata %>%
#   group_by(ChangeInConfidence, Position) %>%
#   tally() %>%
#   filter(!is.na(ChangeInConfidence)) %>%
#   group_by(Position) %>%
#   mutate(n_status = sum(n)) %>%
#   filter(!is.na(Position)) %>%
#   mutate(perc = n / n_status * 100)
# 
# # Check that percentage total is 100 for each status (Position).
# test_output <- change_in_confidence_by_status %>%
#   group_by(Position) %>%
#   summarize(total = sum(perc))
# expect_equal(test_output$total, rep(100, length(status)))
```

```{r longterm_change_in_confidence_by_status}
# ggplot(data = change_in_confidence_by_status,
#        aes(x = ChangeInConfidence, y = Position)) +
#   geom_tile(aes(fill = perc), colour = "white") +
#   geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(perc, 1), "%"))) +
#   scale_fill_gradient("Percent",
#                       low = "white",
#                       high = "blue",
#                       limits = c(0, 100)) +
#   xlab("Change in Confidence with Tools by Position") +
#   theme(
#     axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1),
#     panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
#     panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
#     axis.ticks = element_blank(),
#     panel.background = element_blank()
#   )
```


#### Usage of Tools for Research and/or Work

If respondents are using the tools they learned in a Carpentries workshop, we want to know how they are helping. Respondents were asked to check all that apply.

```{r longterm_change_in_conf_eng_by_status}
# Data are in columns 'How-Tools-Learned-Help' through 'Column37'

# how many responses do we have to this question?

n_reponses_tools_learned_help <-
    n_responses_to_the_question(impactdata,
                              from_colname = HowToolsHelped,
                              to_colname = Column37)

# How many responded to either of these?
# They are improving my overall efficienct : How.Tools.Learned.Helped
# They are improving my ability to analyze data. : Column34
# They are improving my ability to manage data. : Column35

relevant_cols <- c("HowToolsHelped", "Column34", "Column35")

rowsums <-
  impactdata %>%
  select(one_of(relevant_cols)) %>%
  # check that each row has a value for at least one col
  # convert to numeric, if NA, then put a zero, otherwise 1
  map_df(., ~ifelse(is.na(.x), 0, 1)) %>%
  # sum to see if any rows have no reponses
  rowSums()

idx <- ifelse(rowsums == 0, FALSE, TRUE)
number_that_tools_helped <- sum(idx)

how_help <-
impactdata %>%
  select(HowToolsHelped:Column37) %>%
  gather(col, how_help) %>%
  group_by(how_help) %>%
  tally() %>%
  filter(!is.na(how_help)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename(`HowToolsHelped` = how_help)

tools_helped <-
impactdata %>%
  select(HowToolsHelped:Column37) %>%
  gather(col, tools_helped) %>%
  group_by(tools_helped) %>%
  tally_and_perc(tools_helped, na.rm = TRUE, question_n = n_reponses_tools_learned_help) %>%
  filter(!is.na(tools_helped)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename(`How Tools Covered Have Helped` = tools_helped)

kable(tools_helped, format = "markdown", row.names = FALSE, col.names = c("How Tools Covered Help Respondents", "n", "%"))
```

#### Contributions to Academic Writing
We are also interested in knowing whether completing a Carpentries workshop contributed to writing of a research article, thesis, dissertation, or grant proposal. 

```{r}
# Code chunk for contributions to academic writing

# how many responded to this question?
rowsums <-
impactdata %>%
  select(Writing) %>%
  # check that each row has a value for at least one col
  # convert to numeric, if NA, then put a zero, otherwise 1
  map_df(., ~ifelse(is.na(.x), 0, 1)) %>%
  # sum to see if any rows have no reponses
  rowSums()

# for all writing responses
idx <- ifelse(rowsums == 0, FALSE, TRUE)
n_responsed_to_writing <-  sum(idx)

# table about writing
impactdata %>%
  tally_and_perc(Writing,
                 na.rm = TRUE,
                 question_n = n_responsed_to_writing) %>%
  
  kable(,format = 'markdown', row.names = NA, col.names = c("Have Tools Contributed to Respondents' Writing?", "n", "%"))


writing = c("No.", "Not sure.", "Yes.")
writing = factor(writing)

impactdata$Writing = factor(impactdata$Writing, levels = writing)
Contributed_Writing <- round(prop.table(table(impactdata$Writing)) * 100)
```
#### Involvement with the Carpentries
We asked respondents to indicate their involvement in the Carpentries community since completing a Carpentry workshop. Respondents were asked to check all that apply.
```{r}
# Code for involvement (rows Involvement through Column57)
# I want to use the tally_and_perc function, but don't know where to put the question_n
Carpentry_Involvement <-
impactdata %>%
  select(Involvement:Column57) %>%
  gather(col, Carpentry_Involvement) %>%
  group_by(Carpentry_Involvement) %>%
  tally() %>%
  filter(!is.na(Carpentry_Involvement)) %>%
  mutate(perc = round(n/sum(n) * 100, 0)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename(`Involvement Since Attending a Carpentry Workshop` = Carpentry_Involvement)

kable(Carpentry_Involvement, format = 'markdown', col.names = c("Respondents Involvement with The Carpentries", "n", "%"))
```

#### Continuous Learning
Which of the following learning activities (for data management and analysis) have you participated in since completing a Carpentry workshop? Check all that apply.
```{r}
# Code chunk for continuous learning

Learning_Activities <-
impactdata %>%
  select(ContinuousLearning:Column63) %>%
  gather(col, Learning_Activities) %>%
  group_by(Learning_Activities) %>%
  tally() %>%
  filter(!is.na(Learning_Activities)) %>%
  mutate(`%` =round(n / sum(n) * 100, 0) ) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename(`Continuous Learning Post-Workshop` = Learning_Activities)

# Code chunk for table of continuous learning activities
kable(Learning_Activities,
      format = "markdown",
      row.names = FALSE,
      col.names = c("Respondents' Continuous Learning Activities", "n", "%"))
```


# Recommending Carpentries Workshops
Have respondents recommended a Carpentry workshop to a friend or colleague? Responses provided below.
```{r}
# Code chunk for whether respondents recommended a workshop
recommended <-
impactdata %>%
  select(Recommended) %>%
  gather(col, Recommended) %>%
  group_by(Recommended) %>%
  tally() %>%
  filter(!is.na(Recommended)) %>%
  mutate(`%` =round(n / sum(n) * 100, 0) ) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename(`Recommended a Workshop?` = Recommended)

# Table for responses of recommendations
kable(recommended, format = 'markdown', col.names = c("Respondents who Recommended a Workshop", "n", "%"))
```
